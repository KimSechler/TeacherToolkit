# 🧪 User Testing Checklist

## ✅ **What's Working**
- ✅ Server starts and runs on port 3000
- ✅ Authentication system (local auth with teacher/password)
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Frontend loads and renders
- ✅ Basic routing works
- ✅ **Fixed**: Login redirect and session management

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Database Setup Required**

### **Priority 1: Real Database Setup**
- ❌ **Mock database causing validation errors**: Zod schemas expect proper data types

**Solution**: Set up Neon/Supabase database using `./setup-database.sh`
